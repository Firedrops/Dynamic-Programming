## Principles of Dynamic Programming

1. Make it work
    1. Represent a recursive problem as a recursive tree (for Memoization) OR iterative table (for Tabulation).
    2. Implement the core recursive OR iterative logic.
    3. Validate that it works.


2. Make it efficient
    1. Identify recursive/iterative structures/patterns.
    2. Add a memo object (dictionary in the case of Python) as an input, often defaulted to an empty dictonary {}.
    3. Add a parameter to look up existing entries in memo, only do calculations if not in memo (and return values into memo).

## Warning
These are my best efforts within time constraints, scripts may not be exhaustively complete or functional.
