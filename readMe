Exploration of Dynamic Programming in Python

Memoization

1. Make it work
1.1 Represent a recursive problem as a tree
1.2 Implement the core recursive logic
1.3 Validate it.

2. Make it efficient
1.1 Identify recursive structures/patterns
1.2 Add a memo object (dictionary for Python)
1.3 Add a parameter to look up existing entries in memo, only do calculations if not in memo (and return values into memo)
